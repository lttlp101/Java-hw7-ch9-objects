## Description

#### Chapter 9 - Objects and Classes

This Java program include the following:

the Main program

To test various operations on the objects of the Pool class.
Perform a series of operations to test each of the methods and the constructors.
In addition, show how to define an array of pool objects from the Pool class
and show the functionality of the class with your array.

the Class Object  - Pool object

The class should have private instance fields to store
* the shape of a pool (oval, rectangular, etc.), 
* length (in feet), width (in feet), 
* depth (in feet), area (in square feet)
* the volume (in cubic feet) of the pool. 

Also provide the following methods:

* A no-arg constructor to initialize the instance variables to values of your choice. 

* A Constructor with parameters to initialize the instance variables to the arguments 
  <br> indicated in the parameter list of the constructor. 
  <br> This constructor to accept as parameters the shape, length, width, and depth of the pool, 
  <br> and set the values for member fields, accordingly. 

* Appropriate methods to set the value of each of the private instance fields. 

* Appropriate methods to get the value of each of the private instance fields. 

* A method to calculate and return the area of the pool. The area is calculated by multiplying length and width. 
  <br> So, area = length * width 

* A method to calculate and return the volume of the pool. The volume is calculated by 
  <br> multiplying depth by length and width. 
  <br> So, volume = length * width * depth 

* A method to display the values of all the variables. This is just a method with a bunch
  <br> of output statements for all the instance variables. 

* A toString() method used to display the values of an object.
